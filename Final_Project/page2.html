                        Since Ezra was in the fifth grade she has been an avid reader. Some of her favorite genres <img id="photo3" src=https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13754361_1751523155130627_5315566832946192345_n.jpg?oh=335420d70efd6be53cd971b4c75a0591&oe=5B0EB80F width=300px height=300px>
                        include: fantasy, young adult, and
                        contemporary. If you would like to see the titles of her favorite series,
                        check the last table <a href="https://ealpasan1.github.io/ecs71718/HTML/table1.html">here.</a>
                        She also enjoys televison shows such as: The Walking Dead, The Big Bang Theory, Grey's Anatomy, RuPaul's Drag Race, etc.
                        Her favorite movies are: The Truman Show, Carrie, and Anastasia.
                        Although she adores books, movies, and televison shows she also has interests in writing. Sprouting from her interest in reading,
                        and achievements in English Language Arts classes, Ezra aspires to work in writing and/or publishing.
                        However, most importantly, she especially values the time she spends with her friends (pictured).
